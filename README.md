Switch Monitoring Dashboard

This project is a simple web-based dashboard to monitor the status of network switches using Python.
It reads a list of switch IPs from a file (switches.txt).
pings them at regular intervals.
and displays their Online/Offline status on a webpage.
If a switch goes offline, it sends an email alert to the admin.
